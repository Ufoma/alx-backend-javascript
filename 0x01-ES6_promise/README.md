# ES6 Promises
================


## Introduction
---------------

ES6 Promises provide a robust way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. This document covers the basics of Promises and their usage.


## What is a Promise?
--------------------

A Promise is a result object that is used to manage asynchronous operations. It represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future.


## States of a Promise
----------------------

A Promise can be in one of the following states:


* **Pending**: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
* **Fulfilled**: Successful operation, Promise is resolved.
* **Rejected**: Failed operation, Promise is rejected.


## Creating Promises
--------------------

### Using the `Promise` Constructor


```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (success) {
    resolve(value); // Fulfill the Promise
  } else {
    reject(error); // Reject the Promise
  }
});
